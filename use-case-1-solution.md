# Solution:
## Recommend a plan that suits the size of the organization (Contoso is a mid-sized organization with 300 users).

## Introduction
To help mitigate fraudulent emails in an organization, Microsoft 365 offers specific features designed to enhance email security. These are generally available in plans like Microsoft 365 Business Premium and Microsoft 365 E5, both of which include advanced threat protection features.

Here are some key tools and features included in these plans:

- Microsoft Defender for Office 365: Provides email threat protection, including anti-phishing, anti-spam, and anti-malware measures. It also includes advanced tools to detect and mitigate threats like spoofing and impersonation.
  
- Exchange Online Protection (EOP): Automatically included in all Microsoft 365 subscriptions, EOP protects against spam, malware, and known viruses.
  
- Safe Links and Safe Attachments: These features proactively protect against malicious URLs and attachments by analyzing them before they're accessed.

- Advanced Threat Analytics: Detects suspicious user or entity behavior to identify threats before they can cause harm.

- Reporting and Tracking: Enables administrators to monitor and investigate email traffic for potential fraudulent activity or unusual patterns.

The Microsoft 365 E5 plan is a great choice for organizations seeking more robust enterprise-grade security, as it offers the most comprehensive security features.
